This bug occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a callback function that modifies a state variable within the component.  If the callback function is asynchronous (e.g., it uses `setTimeout`, `fetch`, or another asynchronous operation), the state variable might not update correctly. This can lead to unexpected behavior or visual glitches, especially if the state update relies on the previous state value. The bug is more likely to be seen when modifying state within the callback of an event listener, such as `onChangeText` in an input field.
